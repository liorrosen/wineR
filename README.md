# wineR
scraping, extracting, and analyzing wine reviews (in R)

- R Notebooks: a web scraper to compile a wine review database, and "wine_text_analysis_and_classification", containing analysis to better understand the relationship among wines varieties through the similarity of their reviews.  

- related content: a helper function multiplot.r, and a csv .txt file of common terms used to describe wine taste

- also see a [Shiny app](https://sadacca.shinyapps.io/wine-findr/) to explore the dataset further, whose code lives [next-door](www.github.com/sadacca/wine-findR)
